# Using-Genetic-Algorithm-to-Select-Best-Portfolio

This research is to design a C++ program to use Artificial Intelligence Genetic Algorithm to select and optimize a SP500 investment portfolio. I try to find the best portfolio that could beat SPY both in the back testing and probation testing. In the program, I retrieve and parse market data, write into database, create the population, implement fitness function, do the crossover and mutation, and finally get the best portfolio after testing and comparing to the index. Nowadays it is popular to combine computer techniques with financial problems, such as selecting the best portfolio that could beat the index. In my project, I apply libcurl, json, and sqlite3, which are widely used software packages and applications. I build this platform using GA technique in order to help selecting portfolio by using past trading and fundamental data. It will improve the possibility to make money by using the strategy I have developed.
